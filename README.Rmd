The goal of `dfprint` is to provide a nicer print method for data frames.

## Installation

Get `dfprint` from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jchrom/dfprint")
```
## How it prints

`dfprint` includes text formatting, additional information such as type/class
of variables, robust printing of list columns, better use of screen-estate,
and better handling of some exotic phenomena such as list columns with symbol elements or 2-d columns.

The readme files on GitHub do not seem to support ANSI formatting, so you better
be viewing this page on the package website.

## Dependencies

Only what comes with base R. If your terminal does not fully support ANSI strings,
you may want to use `options()` to disable offending features, eg.
`options(dfprint_strong = FALSE)`.
